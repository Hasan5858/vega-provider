# Showbox Worker Issue Analysis

## Problem

The Cloudflare Worker is returning the Cloudflare challenge page instead of the actual HTML content.

**Worker Response:**
```
<html>
  <title>Just a moment...</title>
  <!-- Cloudflare challenge JavaScript -->
</html>
```

**Expected Response:**
```
<html>
  <!-- Actual showbox.media content with .movie-item, .flw-item selectors -->
</html>
```

## Root Cause

The current worker code:
```javascript
const res = await fetch(targetUrl, {
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': request.headers.get('User-Agent') || 'Mozilla/5.0',
  }
});
const html = await res.text();
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ html }), ...);
```

This simple fetch **doesn't bypass Cloudflare protection**. Cloudflare detects it's not a real browser and returns the challenge page.

## Solution Required

The worker needs to actually **solve the Cloudflare challenge**. Options:

### Option 1: Use Cloudflare Headers + Cookies (Recommended)
The worker needs to include:
- Proper browser headers (User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language, etc.)
- `cf_clearance` cookie (obtained by solving challenge first time)
- Other Cloudflare-specific headers

### Option 2: Use Puppeteer/Headless Browser
Use Puppeteer or Playwright in the worker to:
1. Navigate to the page
2. Wait for Cloudflare challenge to complete
3. Extract the final HTML
4. Return it

**Note:** Puppeteer requires special setup in Cloudflare Workers (may need Wrangler with miniflare)

### Option 3: Proxy with Cookie Storage
1. Use a browser extension or script to solve Cloudflare challenge once
2. Extract `cf_clearance` cookie
3. Store it in Worker KV (Cloudflare Key-Value storage)
4. Worker uses stored cookie for all requests
5. Cookie needs periodic refresh (they expire)

## Immediate Fix Needed

The worker code should be updated to either:
1. Include proper headers that bypass Cloudflare
2. Or actually solve the JavaScript challenge

## Testing Status

✅ **Catalog** - Working (static data)
❌ **Posts** - Failing (worker returns challenge page, not HTML)
❌ **Search** - Failing (same issue)
❌ **Meta** - Failing (same issue)
❌ **Episodes** - Skipped (depends on Meta)
❌ **Stream** - Skipped (depends on Episodes)

## Next Steps

1. Update the Cloudflare Worker to properly bypass Cloudflare
2. Test worker directly to verify it returns actual HTML (not challenge page)
3. Re-run provider tests once worker is fixed
