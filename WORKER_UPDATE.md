# ⚠️ UPDATED WORKER CODE - REDEPLOY REQUIRED

The worker code has been updated to fix meta and stream extraction. You need to redeploy immediately.

## What Was Fixed

1. **getMeta()** - Now properly extracts:
   - Title from h1 or entry-title
   - Image from WordPress featured image
   - Synopsis from entry-content
   - Type detection (movie vs series)

2. **getStream()** - Now properly extracts:
   - Download buttons (.dwd-button class)
   - Links containing quality indicators (480p, 720p, 1080p)
   - Server type detection (HubCloud, GDFlix, FilePress, etc)
   - Deduplication of links

3. **getEpisodes()** - Now properly extracts:
   - Episode headers with following links
   - Fallback patterns for various formats

## Quick Deploy

1. **Copy entire code** from `/providers/movies4u/worker/index.js`
2. **Go to:** https://dash.cloudflare.com/ → Workers & Pages → movies4u.steep-bread-3c84
3. **Click:** "Quick Edit" or "Edit Code"
4. **Replace ALL code** with the copied content
5. **Click:** "Save and Deploy"
6. **Wait:** ~10 seconds for deployment

## Verify Deployment

After deploying, test again:

```bash
# Test catalog
curl "https://movies4u.steep-bread-3c84.workers.dev?action=catalog"

# Test posts
curl "https://movies4u.steep-bread-3c84.workers.dev?action=posts&page=1" | jq '.count'

# Test meta
curl "https://movies4u.steep-bread-3c84.workers.dev?action=meta&link=https://movies4u.ps/thamma-2025-hindi-hq-hdtc/"

# Test stream
curl "https://movies4u.steep-bread-3c84.workers.dev?action=stream&link=https://movies4u.ps/thamma-2025-hindi-hq-hdtc/"
```

Then run the full test suite in the terminal after deployment is confirmed.
