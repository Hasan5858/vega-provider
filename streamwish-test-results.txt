üìù Test Result Summary:

StreamWish is NOT similar to FileLions!

‚ùå Key Differences:
1. FileLions: Uses eval() unpacking with deobfuscation API
2. StreamWish: Uses domain-based DMCA checking with dynamic redirects

üîç What StreamWish Does:
- Loads heavily obfuscated main.js
- Checks if hostname is in DMCA list
- Redirects to alternate domains
- NO eval() pattern found
- NO embedded video URLs in HTML

‚ö†Ô∏è Extraction Approach Needed:
Option 1: Follow redirects and check for API endpoints
Option 2: Check if streamwish has an API (like /api/file/xyz)
Option 3: May need browser automation (not feasible for mobile)
Option 4: Skip StreamWish - not extractable with current methods

Recommendation: Test if there's an API endpoint pattern
