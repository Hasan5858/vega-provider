# Movies4U Provider v2.5 - Testing & Deployment Guide

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Provider files created (posts.ts, meta.ts, stream.ts, episodes.ts, catalog.ts)
- All provider files compiled successfully (0 errors)
- Build successful: 40.6% size reduction (607KB → 361KB)
- Version updated to 2.5 in manifest.json
- Worker code updated with improved extraction logic

### ⏳ Worker Code Updated & Needs Redeploy
The worker code at `/providers/movies4u/worker/index.js` has been updated to:
1. Fix meta extraction (title, image, synopsis)
2. Fix stream extraction (download links with quality detection)
3. Fix episode extraction (episode patterns)

**YOU MUST REDEPLOY THIS TO CLOUDFLARE BEFORE TESTING**

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Redeploy Worker to Cloudflare

1. **Copy the updated worker code:**
   - Open: `/Users/hasansarkar/Documents/My Project/vega-providers/providers/movies4u/worker/index.js`
   - Select all (Cmd+A) and copy (Cmd+C)

2. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Login to your account

3. **Edit the worker:**
   - Click "Workers & Pages"
   - Click "movies4u.steep-bread-3c84" worker
   - Click "Quick Edit" or "Edit Code"

4. **Deploy:**
   - Select all in editor (Cmd+A)
   - Paste new code (Cmd+V)
   - Click "Save and Deploy"
   - Wait ~10 seconds for deployment

### Step 2: Quick Test

After deployment, run ONE test to verify:
```bash
curl "https://movies4u.steep-bread-3c84.workers.dev?action=posts&page=1" | jq '.count'
```
**Expected:** Should return a number > 0 (20 posts typically)

### Step 3: Full Testing (from vega-providers folder)

After worker is deployed, run the full test:
```bash
cd "/Users/hasansarkar/Documents/My Project/vega-providers"
bash test-worker.sh
```

This will test all 5 endpoints:
- ✅ Catalog (categories)
- ✅ Posts (trending)
- ✅ Posts (category-specific)
- ✅ Meta (movie details)
- ✅ Stream (download links)

### Step 4: If All Tests Pass ✅

```bash
cd "/Users/hasansarkar/Documents/My Project/vega-providers"
git add -A
git commit -m "Movies4U v2.5: Use Cloudflare Worker API for all scraping - simplified provider architecture"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Test in App

1. **Rebuild vega-providers:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Copy updated provider to vega-app:**
   ```bash
   cp -r /Users/hasansarkar/Documents/My\ Project/vega-providers/dist/movies4u /Users/hasansarkar/Documents/My\ Project/vega-app/src/lib/providers/dist/
   ```

3. **Test in app:**
   - Go to vega-app
   - Browse Movies4U provider
   - Search for a movie
   - Click to view details
   - Click to stream
   - Should load with streams

## What to Watch For

### ⚠️ Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Posts count = 0 | Worker not deployed or regex not matching | Verify worker deployment, check Cloudflare logs |
| Meta returns empty image | Image selector not matching | Check if movies4u.ps changed HTML structure |
| Stream count = 0 | No download links found on page | This is expected for pages without download links |
| 404 from worker | URL incorrect | Verify worker URL in posts.ts matches deployed URL |

---

## Current Test Results (Before Worker Redeploy)

```
✅ Catalog: 5 categories returned
✅ Posts (Trending): 20 posts returned
✅ Posts (Bollywood): 14 posts returned
⚠️  Meta: Title extracted, but image/synopsis empty
⚠️  Stream: 0 streams (extraction not working)
```

**After worker redeploy**, all should pass.

## Architecture Overview

```
vega-app
  ↓
provider calls worker URL
  ↓
Cloudflare Worker (movies4u.steep-bread-3c84)
  ↓
movies4u.ps (website)
  ↓
Worker returns clean JSON
  ↓
Provider processes data + uses extractors
  ↓
App displays content
```

Benefits:
- ✅ No decompression issues (Cloudflare handles it)
- ✅ No React Native environment limitations
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Centralized scraping logic
- ✅ Easy to debug and maintain
